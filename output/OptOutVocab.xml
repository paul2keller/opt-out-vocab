<title>Abstract</title>
<simpara>This document describes a proposed Opt-Out Vocabulary that can be used by various methods - be they location-based or unit-based - to describe whether one or more assets may be used as part of a data mining or AI/ML training workflow.</simpara>

<title>Categories</title>
<simpara>The following categories are proposed for use in the Opt-Out Vocabulary, based on the set of use cases identified in the previous section:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>TDM</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Text and Data Mining. The <link xl:href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019L0790&amp;from=EN">Copyright in the Digital Single Market (CDSM) Directive</link> defines TDM as "any automated analytical technique aiming to analyse text and data in digital form to generate information such as patterns, trends and correlations" (Article 2.2).</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Search</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>The act of indexing the content (and/or metadata) of assets for the purpose of retrieval.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>AI Training</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>The act of training an AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning) model using one or more assets as input. This can include training for classification, object detection, as well as generative AI.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Generative AI Training</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>A form of <literal>AI Training</literal> where the AI/ML model being trained can generate new assets based on the training data.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>In addition to the pre-defined categories, it is also expected that some systems may extend this list with additional categories for their particular needs.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_relationship">
<title>Relationship</title>
<simpara>The <literal>TDM</literal> category is the overarching category that includes all of the others. This is because all of those other activities are considered to be forms of TDM.  As such, if a rightsholder opts out of TDM, they are opting out of all of the other categories as well.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>AI Training</literal> category includes <literal>Generative AI Training</literal> as well as other forms of AI training. This is because all generative AI training is a form of AI training, but not all AI training is generative.</simpara>
